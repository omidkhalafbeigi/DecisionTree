# DecisionTree from Scratch using Python

In this repository, I tried to implement DecisionTree ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) on dataset PlayTennis.
My script can be using for extract DecisionTree from dataset and it can't predict new values (because of time limit for my college).
I may implement "predict" part in the future, but right now; I haven't enough time :)
